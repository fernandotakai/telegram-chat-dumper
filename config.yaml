  ## Backup targets ##
  #
  # Array of strings for each category
  # Strings can be either a (partial) name or a telegram-cli "peer_id" value
  # An empty array means "everything in this category"
  # An array containing only null means "nothing in this category"

  # Array of user dialogs to backup
  backup_users: [
    null
  ]

  # Array of group dialogs to backup
  backup_groups: [
    null
  ]

  # Array of supergroup dialogs to backup
  backup_supergroups: [
    null
  ]

  # Array of broadcast channels to backup
  # WARNING: using this can cause a crash when a channel has too many messages
  # to fit in a single chunk (see https://github.com/vysheng/tg/issues/947)
  backup_channels: [
    null
  ]

  # By default telegram-cli returns only the first 100 dialogs/channels
  # We increase this to 1000. If you have even more, increase this value
  maximum_dialogs: 1000


  ## Output options ##

  # Formatters export the JSON output to a different format
  # To enable a formatter, uncomment it along with all of its options
  # If no formatters are enabled, only JSON files are produced
  formatters: {
    #plaintext: {
      #date_format: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
    #},
    #bare: {},
    pisg: {},
  #  html: {
  #    paginate: 1500, # messages per page
  #    use_utc_time: false,
  #    timestamps_every: 50, # messages
  #    loop_video: true, # loop and autoplay videos
  #  },
  }

  # Target directory for the backup files
  # If this is a relative path it will be relative to the script's directory
  # Absolute path starts with '/' or '~'
  backup_dir: '/root/output'

  # Data file naming style:
  # True for "My_Chat_Name.jsonl", false for "193044.jsonl" (fixed id)
  friendly_data_filenames: true

  # True to rename data files when their name changes
  # For example, "My_Chat_Name.jsonl" is renamed to "WhoChangedTheTitle.jsonl"
  update_data_filenames: true

  # Maximum number of messages to backup for each target (0 means unlimited)
  backlog_limit: 0

  # At the time of writing, telegram-cli does not properly detect audio/video
  # These will be recognized as documents instead
  # Stickers are also considered documents
  download_media: {
    photo: false,
    document: false,
    audio: false,
    video: false,
  }

  # False to reference downloaded files in the telegram-cli cache
  # True to copy downloaded media to a dedicated directory per dialog
  copy_media: false

  # True to delete media files from telegram-cli cache right after downloading
  # Effectively turns copy_media into move_media
  # Beware: this will cause media files to be redownloaded every backup run
  delete_media: false

  # When a user's real name is formatted, include their last name if possible
  display_last_name: true


  ## Technical options ##

  # Use a unix socket to communicate with telegram-cli
  # Should match the path passed to telegram-cli with the -S option
  #
  # NB: Setting tg_sock to some not false value will cause the script
  # to ignore the next options about TCP connection

  # tg_sock: "/var/run/telegram.sock"
  tg_sock: null

  # Address of the machine you are running telegram-cli on
  # If this is not localhost telegram-cli must be invoked with --accept-any-tcp
  tg_host: 'localhost'

  # Should match the port passed to telegram-cli with the -P option
  tg_port: 9009

  # Number of messages to request in one chunk
  chunk_size: 100

  # Time in seconds to wait between requesting chunks
  chunk_delay: 1.0

  # Time in seconds to wait before considering a request stuck (0 = infinite)
  chunk_timeout: 10

  # Number of times to retry getting one chunk
  chunk_retry: 3

  # Time in seconds to wait before considering a download stuck (0 = infinite)
  # After this time the script skips to the next message
  media_timeout: 100


  ## Advanced behavior settings ##

  # Enables incremental backups (progress is tracked in <outdir>/progress.json)
  # Setting this to false will force a complete re-run of the backup every time
  track_progress: true

  # Replacement string for the characters in dialog names which are potentially
  # problematic in filenames
  # You can set this to '' if the dialog names are unique enough
  character_substitute: '_'

  # Skip messages if their text matches this Ruby regex
  # Example: '/forbidden|words/i'
  filter_regex: null
